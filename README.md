Experimental page using Yeoman & co. 
========
This was the original incarnation of hannah.io, built with Yeoman and Grunt.  It was also an experiment 
with using Sassy intead of regular old CSS.  I ended up just using the [Static](http://nakkaya.com/static.html) for my 
newly combined blog/personal page, but I though that I might as well keep this around just in case.
